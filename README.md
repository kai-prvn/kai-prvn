### hey, i'm praveen 👋

**aka kaiprvn**

i'm a 2nd year cs student who got tired of just passing exams, so i started building actual things instead.

---

### what i'm doing

building projects, learning product design, and trying to figure out what i actually want to do with my life.

current focus:
- ui/ux design (learning to make things that don't look like shit)
- react + typescript (still feel like i'm faking it, but shipping anyway)
- no-code tools (because sometimes code is overkill)

philosophy: ship fast, learn from real use, iterate. thinking about building something ≠ building it.

---

### recent stuff i built

**[content learning tracker](https://github.com/kai-prvn/content-learning-tracker)** - *oct 2024*  
problem: kept forgetting insights from videos/podcasts  
solution: simple capture + random review system  
tech: react, typescript, tailwind  
learned: product thinking > perfect code, AI tools can 10x speed

more projects coming. i'm trying to ship something every 2 weeks.

### learning in public

i'm sharing the messy process of learning to build products:
- [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiprvn/) - longer thoughts, project breakdowns
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/kaiprvn) - daily updates, quick learnings

still figuring out what "building in public" actually means, but trying it anyway.

---

### what i'm learning

**right now:**
- design fundamentals (typography, color, layout)
- figma (designing before building)
- how to get my first freelance clients

**next:**
- framer or webflow (faster than coding everything)
- actually understanding the react code AI generates for me
- how to talk about my work without sounding fake

---

### if you're also starting out

some things that helped me finally start:
1. stopped waiting to "learn everything first"
2. built something i actually needed
3. used AI as a teacher, not a crutch
4. shipped even though it felt incomplete

still have no idea what i'm doing half the time. but now i'm doing it anyway.

---

### open to

- freelance design/dev work (need to start earning)
- remote internships (learning + income)
- feedback on my projects (be honest)
- connecting with other people building stuff
