### hey, i'm praveen

**aka kaiprvn**

2nd year cs student trying to figure out what i actually want to do by building things.

---

### the journey so far

started trying to code. built one project with AI help.

realized: i don't like coding. i like the design/creative side.

so i'm pivoting to ui/ux design + no-code tools.

this is me figuring it out in public.

---

### what i'm learning now

**design:**
- ui/ux fundamentals (typography, color, layout)
- figma (design tool)
- framer (no-code website builder)

**philosophy:**
- it's okay to try something and realize it's not for you
- pivoting isn't failing, it's learning
- you find yourself by doing, not thinking

---

### what i've built

**[content learning tracker](https://github.com/kai-prvn/content-learning-tracker)** - oct 2025

my first project. used AI + React to build it.  
learned: shipping something > perfect plans  
also learned: i don't actually like coding

**[framer projects coming soon]**  
redesigning and rebuilding things without code  
focusing on design, not syntax

---

### what i believe

- you learn by doing, not preparing
- using AI/no-code isn't cheating, it's being smart
- it's okay to pivot when you realize something isn't for you
- design matters more than perfect code
- find yourself by creating, not consuming

---

### current focus

**learning:**
- ui/ux design (figma, design systems, user experience)
- framer (building beautiful websites without code)
- making things that don't look like shit

**building:**
- portfolio in framer
- redesigning my projects to actually look good
- shipping design work

**figuring out:**
- what kind of designer i want to be
- what problems i want to solve
- how to turn this into income

---

### open to

- freelance design work (figma designs, framer builds)
- ui/ux design internships (remote preferred)
- feedback on my work (be brutally honest)
- connecting with other designers learning in public
