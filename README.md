### hey, i'm praveen

**aka kaiprvn**

2nd year cs student trying to figure out what i actually want to do by building things.

---

### the experiment

built my first project two weeks ago.

now i'm testing different paths:
- coding (do i like the logic/problem-solving?)
- design (do i like the visual/creative side?)
- no-code (do i like building fast without syntax?)

giving myself 4 weeks to try each properly.

then i'll know.

### what i've built

**[content learning tracker](https://github.com/kai-prvn/content-learning-tracker)** - oct 2025  
note-taking app with spaced repetition  
built with AI + React  
learned: shipping > thinking about shipping

**[more projects coming as i experiment]**

### what i believe

- you learn by doing, not preparing
- it's okay to not know your path yet
- trying > overthinking
- using tools (AI, no-code) is smart
- figure yourself out by creating, not consuming

---

### currently

**learning:**
- react/frontend (understanding how code works)
- figma/ui-ux (exploring design)
- framer/no-code (trying alternatives)

**building:**
- experimenting with different types of projects
- posting progress publicly
- figuring out what clicks

**open to:**
- feedback on work
- learning from others
- opportunities to try different things
- connecting with people also figuring it out

---

💡 **do what inspires**

(still figuring out what that is - that's the point)
